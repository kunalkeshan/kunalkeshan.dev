    motivation:
      'I founded Shiryoku with the goal of reducing the barrier between students and the resources they need to up-skill themselves. During my third year of college, I was inspired by the philosophy "be the senior you needed the most as a junior." With Shiryoku, I aim to provide students with access to the best resources based on their individual needs, and to guide them with a roadmap for a structured approach to maximize the resources. This initiative is my way of giving back and helping the next generation of students achieve their goals.',

    motivation:
      'As a student who took all my classes online, I struggled with finding relevant readings and organizing my time effectively. I felt isolated without the opportunity to interact with upperclassmen and receive guidance on how to effectively use the materials I was given. Inspired by the idea of "being the senior I needed the most as a junior", I created this repository to provide support for anyone who needs access to relevant study materials. This project is my way of making a difference and helping others succeed, just as I wish I had a senior to guide me during my online studies.',

Welcome to my portfolio v2.0, I don't remember where v1.0 is so don't ask me about it. This project is an inspiration from another portfolio template called [Paperfolio](https://paperfolio.webflow.io/) and I've customized it to my own needs and preferences.

This project is fully responsive, with extendable features and consistent design. Showcasing your best skills, projects and experiences. Feel free to fork and use for your own portfolio.

Below I've mentioned a general overview of my portfolio and how you can fork and use it for your own as well (make sure to tag me 😉)
